                <p>

                    We are a dynamic trio of programming students with a passion for cooking and technology. Our journey began in the university classrooms, where we discovered our shared fascination for simplifying everyday life through digital innovation.

                    Together, we have created DishDash, a recipe search application that not only allows you to find the best and most varied recipes, but also helps you organize your weekly menu. Our goal is to make meal planning easier, faster, and more fun for everyone, regardless of your cooking skill level.
